## University-Thesis 🏫

Despite graduating as a Bachelor of Logistics and Supply Chain, my thesis was more likely to be a Data Analysis project 😂😂. It is so funny to think about that after 1 year.

This might be destiny, I think 🙋‍♂️.

In my Thesis, I only use Arena Simulation to build a simulation model for a hospital to look for some drawbacks and bottlenecks. Then using Cplex for optimizing resources. 

### I would like to thank MSc. Nguyen Hoang Huy for helping me in my thesis. 🙏🙏🙏
